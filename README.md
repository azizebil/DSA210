# Weather and Productivity Analysis

## Project Overview

This project investigates the relationship between weather conditions and productivity, specifically screen time usage. By analyzing weather data alongside screen time statistics, we aim to determine if factors such as temperature, cloud cover, and sunlight hours impact work efficiency, social media usage, and entertainment consumption.

## Datasets

### 1. Weather Data

Weather data will be sourced from Meteoroloji Genel Müdürlüğü (General Directorate of Meteorology). The dataset includes:

- **Date (YYYY-MM-DD)**
- **Temperature (°C)**
- **Humidity (%)**
- **Precipitation (mm)**
- **Cloud Cover (%)**
- **Wind Speed (m/s)**
- **Weather Condition** (Clear, Rain, Snow, Cloudy, etc.)
- **Sunlight Hours** (hours of daylight per day)
- **Extreme Weather Conditions** (Snow, Rain, Storms, etc.)

### 2. Productivity (Screen Time) Data

Screen time data will be gathered from both my computer and phone. Additionally, my phone will record sleep data. The dataset includes:

- **Date (YYYY-MM-DD)**
- **Total Screen Time** (hours)
- **Time Spent on Work Apps** (Google Docs, IDEs, emails, etc.)
- **Time Spent on Social Media** (Instagram, Twitter, etc.)
- **Time Spent on Gaming Apps**
- **Time Spent on YouTube/Entertainment**
- **Break Frequency** (How often breaks are taken)
- **Sleep Data** (Recorded from phone)

## Research Questions

1. Does higher temperature correlate with more time on social media?
2. Does cloudy weather increase gaming time?
3. Does more sunlight improve work productivity?
4. Do extreme weather conditions impact productivity and screen time?

## Hypothesis

- **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: Weather conditions have no significant impact on screen time productivity.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: Weather conditions significantly influence productivity and screen time usage.

## Methods

### Data Collection

- Weather data will be collected from Meteoroloji Genel Müdürlüğü (General Directorate of Meteorology).
- Screen time data will be extracted from my computer and phone applications.
- Sleep data will be recorded using my phone.

### Data Preparation and Analysis

1. **Data Cleaning**: Remove missing values, format dates, and normalize data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identify trends, outliers, and distributions.
3. **Correlation Analysis**: Examine relationships between weather variables and productivity. Categorize days into "High Productivity," "Low Productivity," and "Moderate Productivity."

## Data Collection Period

The data will be collected over 14 weeks from the start of the academic term.

## Expected Outcomes

1. Identification of weather conditions that enhance or hinder productivity.
2. Insights into behavioral patterns based on environmental factors.
3. A predictive model for estimating productivity based on weather conditions.
